Welcome to my GitHub Profile Page ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a first year student pursuing an Applied Mathematics degree with a CS Specialization at Ryerson University.

Always happy to talk about anything!

I'm especially interested in developing applications and algoritms and aspire to work in the field of Data, Software Engineering, and Full-Stack Development.

Most of my repositories are private for now, but I will consider making some of them public in the near future.
