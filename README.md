Welcome to my GitHub Profile Page ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a third year student pursuing a Mathematics and Computer Science degree at Ryerson University (now known as Toronto Metropolitan University).

Always happy to talk about anything!

I'm especially interested in developing applications involving the use of algorithms and aspire to work in the field of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Development.

Most of my repositories are private for now, but I will consider making some of them public in the near future.
